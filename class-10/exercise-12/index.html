A smart door that greets people who belong there and drives away who doesnt

If (person name) belongs to of a teacher catgory, then it would reply something like 'Hello Mr/Ms (name).'
Else if (person name) belongs to of a student category, then it would say 'Hello, student (name).'
Else it would say 'Please leave the premise' to those who aren't part of the building.
Ex:
<Script>

    if (name = (teachername)){
        'Hello, Mr/Ms (name)'
    }else if (name = (studentname)) {
        'Hello, student (name)'
    }else {                           //these are for those who are not in the database and are not supposed to be there.
        'Please leave the premise'   
    }       
</Script>
